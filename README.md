# ExoticCraft
### ExoticCraft is a `rip-off` of [Minecraft](https://minecraft.net)
### This project is made in `C++` and uses [Raylib](https://raylib.com) for rendering
### How to download
* Clone the repository
* You must have installed Raylib header files from [raylib.com](https://raylib.com)
* Run the `run.cmd` file. if it shows a warning, click on `More info` then click `Run anyway`
* Or alternatively you could run the command `mingw32-make main` or `make main`
### NOTE: This project is in developement and has many bugs, Raycast does not work sometimes on block placement / breaking
### I have no intension of making it like just Minecraft, this project is intended to simulate Redstone, or rather "Computation Redstone"
## Controls
* `W` `A` `S` `D` to move
* `Q` To toggle Spectator mode
* `Space` To jump / fly up in Spectator mode
* `Shift` To sneak / fly down in Spectator mode
* `Left Click`  To break Block
* `Right Click` To place block
## AND YES AUTO JUMP IS TURNED ON DON'T ASK WHY. (Because of my bad collision detection code)
